Grocery list

this is one of the biggest projects that I have made. Right now there are some features:

- adding items to list
- temporary alerts after every major event
- option to delete items from list
- option to reset the list completely
- edit the name of item option
- implemented local storage (big one for me)

Moreover, I was trying to implement some tips from book called "Clean Code". I see a big improvement in readability of code. It was way more fun to code this project.
